<h2>Thank you for having a look at my portfolio. </h2>
<p>I am a third year Game-Art student at Mediacollege Amsterdam.</p>
<p>I am currently doing an internship at Azerion. As an artist I like to focus on 2D character design, user interface, animation and assets.
My main goal is to make people smile through my art.</p>
<p>In my second year of my education (2017/2018) I had the great opportunity to join an excellence program.
I loved working with al the other courses and learned a lot from it.
I also learned where my skills come in handy: visualizing ideas</p>
